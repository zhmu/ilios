Building ILIOS
--------------

Before you can build ILIOS, you must first create a symlink to the appropriate
architecture directory:

$ cd src
$ ln -s arch/i386 md
$ cd include
$ ln -s arch/i386 md

You can then build ILIOS/i386.

Creating a bootable floppy
--------------------------

ILIOS uses GRUB to boot, so you must have that installed before you can build
the image. When it is present, you can simply use the tools/build-grub.sh
script to generate a bootable image.

When in the src/ directory, you can use 'make copy' to copy the build kernel
image to the floppy disk. You need mtools for this to work. Only a properly
generated floppy using tools/build-grub.sh will work.
