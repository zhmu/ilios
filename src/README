This is the full source code to ILIOS; dubbed the InterLink Internet Operating
System. It is a standalone OS, which supports high-speed IPv4 routing.

Only a handful of NIC's are supported (all ported from OpenBSD):

- RealTek 8139
- NE2000 clones
- 3Com EtherLink III

The code is a good learning base for netwerk operating system programming. The
buffer implementation is a bit crude, as it was designed to perform well
on even the worst network cards (hence no complex links within the structure,
such as what *BSD's mbufs do).

This code is BSD licensed, so have great joy with it. The reason I quit with
the project was mostly due to the lack of time and being a bit disappointed
with the performance (it could only beat NetBSD by a faction, if using a
RealTek ... whereas NetBSD usually had to do much memcpy 's and the likes to
properly allign the buffer)

It builds on a FreeBSD 5.4 box, and runs fine using Bochs. Bochs' NE2000
card gets successfully probed, but I was unable to do futher testing. Should
something be broken, feel free to provide patches :)
